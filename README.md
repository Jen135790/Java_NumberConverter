# Java_NumberConverter
A simple Java application that converts decimal to hexadecimal or roman numeral, 
hexadecimal to decimal or roman numeral, and roman numeral to decimal or hexadecimal. The GUI is small, simple, and clean.

####Overview
This is a small project that uses 3 different objects to handle the three different number types (decimal, hexadecimal, and roman). The three object classes handle input validations and conversions while the main class creates a GUI for user input. This was initially a project that was done for my college Adv Java class but that version used the console to output the conversions/errors.

####Features
- User can choose the initial number type and desired number type!
- If user enters a value that isn't in the number range specified, the label will turn red as a reminder.
